Claudio Monteverdi is considered one of the pioneers of the Baroque style and the development of the *melodramma*, the origin of the *opera*. However also his contribution to the Renaissance  madrigal style was substantial both in number and in quality.

Through the performing of his books of Madrigals one can hear the echoes of great masters such as Cipriano de Rore and Luca Marenzio and the influence of his contemporary Giaches de Wert. Ultimately it is the genius of Monteverdi itself which would stretch the renaissance madrigal style to a point that innovation and tradition would merge in something unique. Monteverdi's years in Mantua most certainly created the right context for the creation of so many masterpieces by one of the most influential composer in the late Renaissance period.

The project repertoire will comprise a large range of Monteverdi compositions from the first book to the sixth book of madrigals leading to one of the most representative of the Monteverdi madrigal style: the madrigals bundle called *Il Lamento d’Arianna*. Together with the music of Monteverdi also the masters who influenced his music, as Cipriano de Rore and Giaches de Wert, will be part of the repertoire.
