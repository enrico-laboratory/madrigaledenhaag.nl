## Madrigale Den Haag

Madrigale Den Haag focus their repertoire on the Italian madrigal of the 16th and 17th centuries. The madrigal was the most elevated and performed secular music genre in the Renaissance Italian courts. MDH programs explore the madrigal styles coming from Italian courts and their prominent musicians. The performances will be a full immersion in that fascinating genre, its historical context and its poetry, which for many years would have been the entertainment of musically educated amateurs and their selected guests.
## Conductor
Enrico Ruggieri, born in 1982, after graduating as pianist, found his vocation in conducting choir. He studied choral music and conducting in Rome, Bologna and finally got a Master Degree at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague. He perfected himself attending masterclasses in conducting and early music by internationally renowned specialists.

He conducted many ensembles of different sizes and genres, favouring the polyphonic style and the madrigal music of the late Renaissance and early Baroque style. He extensively researched, transcribed and performed sacred Portuguese music in the 18th century.

Presently Enrico Ruggieri conducts the Haags Renaissance Kamerkoor and the project choirs Madrigale Den Haag and Kamerkoor Koorteze.
