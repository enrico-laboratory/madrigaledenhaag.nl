Madrigale Den Haag will perform madrigals by the most prominent musician in Mantua of the mid 16th century: Giaches de Wert. 

He was known for his highly expressive musical language, great contrasts and declamatory style. 
He seemed to have reached the perfect match between poetry and music in the madrigal style. 
The music of his teacher, Cipriano de Rore, and together with the music of the musicians 
who further developed his style, like Claudio Monterverdi, will bring the listener closer to 
that fascinating style, to the music of the Duchy of Mantua and the famous Sforza family court.
